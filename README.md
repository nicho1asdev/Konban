# Konban
I've been working really hard on rewriting Nepeta's Konban tweak for iOS 13 as it's only supported by iOS 12. As you may or may not know, the tweak developer Nepeta retired last year (I think) making tweaks. Fortunately all of her work was open sourced so other people are able to update the amazing free tweaks that she made.

iOS 13 changed a lot of stuff in the FrontBoard framework regarding FBScenes and FBSceneHosts. I did very much research to understand and implement the new way of getting the host view and much more.

The tweak is in beta and free and on my repo: https://nicho1asdev.github.io/repo/.

KNOWN ISSUES: Keyboard is invisible but typable in Konban's view. Feel free to commit changes if you find a fix.
